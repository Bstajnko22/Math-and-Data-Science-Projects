# Math-and-Data-Science-Projects
Collection of random projects I've been working on in python.

Hey Everyone,

In this repo you'll find a bunch of random math and data science projects Ive been working on as I've been learning Python.

The projects work with many different machine learning models on datasets ive obtained from online. Im hoping to add some more in the future,
particularly more projects with deep learning and time series analysis.

Cheers, Billy.
