# Math-and-Data-Science-Projects
Collection of random projects I've been working on in python as I learn.

Hey legends,

In this repo you'll find a bunch of random math and data science related projects Ive been working on as I've been learning Python.

So far there is only two projects, that being a monte carlo simulator for financial markets and a machine learning/linear model for predicting Australian petrol prices.
Keep in mind these projects are just random playarounds, so they're not the most rigorous.

I'm hoping to add more in the future, especially some projects sorrounding weather and climate data.

Cheers, Billy.
